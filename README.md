For this assignment we are given some example code from the instructor and in the code there are certain things that can be fixed or modifed in the code to make it run differently or display something else. By adding my own comments and adding my own code I am able to follow the instructors instructions to modify the code.
Have to periodically check and run the code through powershell and would run into some bugs here and there but for the most part it seemed to work for the parts that I did fix.
